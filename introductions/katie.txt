If I was stuck on an island and I got to bring one food with me I would bring peanut butter. Not only do I love the taste, but I think this is very practical. It is high in fat (which is good if you aren't eating much) and protein (good for your muscles!) and sugar (good for energy!) and would make gross foods I might have to eat (like plants or bugs) more edible!
